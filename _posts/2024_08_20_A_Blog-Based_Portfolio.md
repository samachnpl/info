# A Blog-Based Portfolio

This website is designed as a showcase for text-based portfolio items, using the WordPress blog structure to present each item in a separate, dated blog post. The [Recent Works](https://wp.nyu.edu/samratacharya/recent-works/) page is an index to the posts, displaying brief excerpts in reverse chronological order. The [homepage](https://wp.nyu.edu/samratacharya/) presents a mini-index of just the most recent four posts.
