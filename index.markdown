Namaste! I am Samrat Acharya, a research scientist/engineer at [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov). With a passion for advancing the field of clean, reliable and secure energy systems, I specialize in cyber-physical modeling, data-driven decisions in energy systems, power system analysis, and renewable energy systems.

I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at New York University (NYU). Under the guidance of [Dr. Yury Dvorkin](https://ydvorkin.github.io/) and [Dr. Ramesh Karri](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/ramesh-karri), I conducted research in the field of energy systems and cybersecurity. During my time at NYU, I was a proud member of the [SEARCH Lab](https://ydvorkin.github.io/index.html) and the [NYU Center for Cybersecurity](https://cyber.nyu.edu), where I collaborated with esteemed professionals in the field of energy systems and cybersecurity.

With a background in electrical engineering from Pokhara University and a Master's degree in Electrical Power Engineering from [Masdar Institute (in cooperation with MIT)](http://web.mit.edu/mit-mi-cp/), I bring a global perspective to my research.

This website showcases my research, publications, and contributions to the field. I invite you to explore and connect with me for engaging discussions and collaborations.

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting with you!
